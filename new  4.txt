the formatting of your javascript is very neat and readable. Good, sensible divisions of code.
good variable names

it might be worth considering having a setup function that is called when the document is ready. this would avoid the problem of having multiple
$(document).ready statements

you have a lot of repeating jquery calls. Could you make an array of all the variables you want to do a specific function on
and then do some sort of for loop? This will probably cut down on the amount of code by a fair amount. (for example when you're
setting up IPAPulmonic around line 256 of IPA.js

A few times you add something to every span in the document (like in IPAconverter.js line 77). Will this cause problems with
embedding? What if there are already spans in the document? Maybe it would be safer to add a class to all your spans and then
perform whatever function you want on that class only.

ewwwww IPAdata.js is soooo ugly. Pretty sure that's not your fault at all though
